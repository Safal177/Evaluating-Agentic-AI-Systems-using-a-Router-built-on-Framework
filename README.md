# Evaluating-Agentic-AI-Systems-using-a-Router-built-on-Framework


# Project Title:
End-to-End Agentic AI System with Router oriented Decision Making

# Project Objective:
Key objectives are:
•	Make a route oriented Agentic AI system
•	Run this system
•	Select a tool using an LLM
•	Show how this system works as Data loading, data analysis, data visualization
•	Evaluate this system with automated pipelines.

# Main tools:
•	Python programming includes Pandas, Matplotlib, CSV dataset)
•	OpenAI (gpt-4.1-mini)
•	Data analysis
•	Routing decisions
•	code produced for Visualization
•	Agentic system (tool-oriented agent structure, routing by LLM reasoning, code generated by LLM)

# Core facts:
•	Agent controlled task handling
•	Conditional Agent Routing
•	End to end data workflow 
•	Reflecting prompt engineering

# Is this project useful in current competitive business/research market? 
Yes or no. Check skills used in this project demanding for key roles in 
•	Agentic AI Engineer
•	Prompt Engineer
•	LLM Engineer
•	Data Scientist based on LLM-environment
•	AI solutions system
